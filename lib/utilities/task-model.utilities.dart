  // In normal constructor, an instance gets created and the final variables get instantiated with the initializer list.
  // This is why there's no return statement. The instance to return is already fixed, when executing the constructor!
  //
  // In a factory constructor, the instance to return is decided by the method.
  // That's why it needs a return statement and why it'll usually call a normal constructor in at least one path.
  //
  // So a factory does nothing different than a static method could do (in other languages often called getInstance()),
   // except you cannot overload the constructor with a static method but you can with a factory method.
  // I.e. factory methods are a way to hide the fact that the user of your class is not calling a constructor but a static method
  //
